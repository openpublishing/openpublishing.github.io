The `story` card is where it all begins: it is the alpha and the omega, the outermost block of JSON that contains all other cards as well as _all_ the information required by `OpenPub`. All other cards are optional.

### Example

````json
{
  "type": "story",
  "version": 1,
  "home": "http://publisher.example.com/canonical-url",
  "cards": []
}
````

### Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose | Caveats | Version |

| home | string | The unique URL associated with this story. | Must be a valid URL. | 1 |
| cards | array | An array of cards that describe this story. | Optional. | 1 |
