`OpenPub` is a portable way to represent content using `JSON`, `XML`, and other data formats.

It also includes a few "best practices" to help this representation evolve over time.

### Why?

The goal of Open Publishing is simple: to allow you to **publish once, everywhere**.

Today, that's surprisingly difficult. Many hours are spent manually tweaking content for specific platforms like Facebook, reddit, and Twitter.

As a content creator, your time shouldn't be spent on hacking infrastructure. Your focus is creating great content.


#### The Problem

Publishing is manual and time-consuming. Content creators are forced to publish content via many platforms, each with different requirements and best practices.

As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage content in all the places that it will, inevitably -- if not hopefully -- appear.

#### The Solution

`OpenPub` aims to provide a single, simple, and clear way to communicate your story to **all** platforms at once. Let the platforms take care of optimizing your content for their users. That's their business, after all.

#### Will I Lose Control?

Publishers aspire to reach a specific audience. Networks aspire to grow engagement. These goals are collaborative!

`OpenPub` embraces the distributed structure of the web and provides a way to collaborate so that everyone can benefit.
