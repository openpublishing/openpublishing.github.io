### It's About Your Audience

In a perfect world, we'd have a consistent format, curated by leaders within the community, that worked "out of the box" with every distribution channel and platform. Stuff like:

 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - Pinterest
 - WordPress
 - Reddit
 - Your own site
 - Your own app
 - Dead trees

You'd put together some content, package it nicely, add as much metadata as you like -- and you're done. You focus on telling your story and the platforms focus on reaching people.

This is the goal of `OpenPub`. While the world isn't perfect, we aim to make things a little easier. And we've got our `helpers`, our community, and our best intentions to get us there.

### More, Not Less

In general, we leave it up to the platform (i.e., the place where your content will appear) to determine what data to use and what to ignore. Each card is associated with a set of `helpers` that can create it and platforms that can read it.

Adding more metadata will never hurt you-- it'll only make your content smarter (or at the least, more engaging). You're adding potential, not picking and choosing between proprietary formats. And that's the gist of what makes `OpenPub` special.
