### Summary

All content is broken down into sections which contain an ordered list of content items. Sections share several common traits including title and subtitle and can be used to group related items together. This is useful when you wish to attach special meaning to a block of content (like a geotag or an audio narration).

### Example

````json
{
  "type": "section",
  "title": "An incredible journey",
  "subtitle": "Brace yourself for adventure",
  "body": [...]
}
````
