OpenPub is a simple set of tools designed to fascilitate smarter content distribution on the open web. For instance, journalists can use OpenPub to address specific audiences, weave stories into storylines, and to engage with commentators and experts.

Importantly, OpenPub is built atop open technology that you're already familiar with: tools like RSS, markdown, and semantic HTML5.

{% highlight html %}
<article>
  <header>This is an article</header>
  <p>Hello, World!</p>
</article>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that this site is powered by Jekyll--- contributors should familiarize themselves with this simple framework.
