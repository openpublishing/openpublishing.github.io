`OpenPub` is just a bunch of `JSON` (or `XML`, or `YAML`, or whatever) that describes -- and *optionally* contains -- your content.

You can put it just about anywhere:

 - In an RSS feed
 - In an API call
 - In your HTML markup

Its purpose is to retire [web scraping][1] by making content widely available -- all while protecting your brand and your intentions.
