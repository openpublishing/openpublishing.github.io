`OpenPub` is, at its core, just a bunch of `JSON` that describes --- and optionally contains -- your content.

You can put it just about anywhere:

 - In an RSS feed
 - In an API call
 - In your markup
 - In someone's toaster
 - Wherever!

Its purpose is to make [web scraping][1] a thing of the past.

Let's just call it like it is: your content is *everywhere*, whether you like it or not. If you're savvy and want to reach as many people as possible, you'll want your content to be *easily* portable. If not... ever heard of pets.com?

`OpenPub` is how you do this--- while maintaining your brand _and_ your journalistic control.
