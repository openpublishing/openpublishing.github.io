`OpenPub` is a collection of data written as `JSON` (or `XML`, `YAML`, or anything you like) that describes -- and *optionally* contains -- your content.

You can publish it however you prefer:

 - Via an RSS feed
 - Via an API call
 - Via your HTML markup

Its purpose is to retire [web scraping][1] by making detailed content widely available -- all while preserving your brand and your voice.
