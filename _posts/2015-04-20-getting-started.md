### Overview

The goal of `OpenPub` is simple: **write once, read everywhere**.

Today, that's a surprisingly difficult goal. You'll likely want to "hand publish" your work to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and so on --- especially if you want people to, you know, read it.


As a writer/editor/journalist/human, optimizing your content for a zillion networks is probably not the best use of your time. Your job shouldn't be writing weird markup or posting things at 2 AM or `hacking the system`. Your job is to tell an engaging story... engagingly.


### The Problem

Trouble is, that's not how the world is set up today. Every network speaks a different language and expects a different input. You need to babysit your content and craft it carefully (in small batches) for each and every network people use to get their news.


### The Solution

This is what `OpenPub` is all about: providing a single, simple, and clear way to communicate your story to **all** the networks at once. Stop fretting about the details.

Very importantly:

 - It's not a painful standard.
 - It's not a new format.
 - It's not a radical, new idea.

`OpenPub` is a simple tool to make your content more portable and more accessible. Write once, read everywhere.
