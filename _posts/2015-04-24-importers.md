The web is messy.

We've got billions of formats and trillions of versions, plus people write bad code and invalid markup and stuff that doesn't make sense (technically or, well, otherwise).

If our goal is to **write once, read everywhere**, the first step is to build a bridge between the messy reality of real content -- and our predictable, friendly `openpub` content.

In other words, we need to transform stuff like `HTML5`, `RSS`, `ATOM`, `Flipboard Markup`, and so on into `openpub'. That's what an `Importer` does.

Rather than have every developer write code to scrape these formats, we've banded together to build a rich library of *Importer*s so you don't have to.

What about going the other direction? Taking `openpub` content and making it work on an existing service? For that, we have [exporters][1].
