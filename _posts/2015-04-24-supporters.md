### Cool Sites Use OpenPub

Importing and exporting is cool... but it's really just a hack to deal with the messy reality of today's web.

The ideal would be to have a consistent format, curated by leaders within the community, that worked "out of the box" with the most influential distribution channels. Stuff like:

 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - Pinterest
 - WordPress
 - Reddit
 - Your own site
 - Your own app
 - An old-fashioned newspaper

You'd just put together your content, wrap it in some `OpenPub`, add as much metadata as you like -- and you're done.

### More, Not Less

Since `OpenPub` is so modular, we leave it up to the network (i.e., place where your content will appear) to determine what data to use and what to ignore. Each card is associated with a set of `importer`s that can generate it, `exporter`s than can convert it, and
networks that can utilize that data natively.

Adding more metadata will never hurt you-- but it might make your content more engaging on several networks or websites. You're adding potential, not picking and choosing between proprietary formats.
