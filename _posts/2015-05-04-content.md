This card is among the most important in `OpenPub`. It is the "source" of your article: the raw content, broken down into a consistent, portable format that all platforms can interpret. This card captures meaning without presentation (i.e., how your content will be shown).

### Example

````json
{
  "type": "content",
  "version": 1,
  "title": "An incredible journey",
  "subtitle": "Brace yourself for adventure",
  "body": [...]
}
````

### Discussion

The content card is sort of like a super card. With super card powers.
