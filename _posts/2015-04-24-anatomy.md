### It's Just JSON

The nifty thing about `OpenPub` is that it's modular and simple. Why? Because modern publishing is "multidisciplinary and dynamic". It's a moving target (standards aren't so good at those).

A purely technical solution won't work -- and neither will a purely editorial one. We need something adaptive and friendly and realistic. Something that can evolve and play well with others.

Here's what barebones `OpenPub` looks like:

````json
{
  "type": "story",
  "help": "http://documentation-for-this-card/",
  "version": 1,
  "revision": 1,
  "home": "http://publisher.example.com/article",
  "cards": [...]
}
````

That's it.

A story has a `help` field which both identifies and links to the documentation for the corresponding version, a `home` URL which links to the content's canonical location, a `revision` number that is updated every time you revise the content, and a collection of `card`s--- *a.k.a.* the good stuff.

Each card is a collection of info related to the story, typically sharing a theme (like "geographic metadata" or "article source content" or "associated memes").

*Anyone* in the `OpenPub` community is free to define cards and use them to capture interesting metadata. Cards that enter into wide usage will be documented [here][1] and deemed sticky.

Sticky cards are more likely to be supported by `helpers`, which we'll talk about [next][2].
