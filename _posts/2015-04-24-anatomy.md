The nifty thing about `OpenPub` is that it's extremely modular. Why? Because modern publishing is  multidisciplinary and dynamic. A purely technical solution won't work -- and neither will a purely editorial one. We need something adaptive and friendly.

Here's what your essential `OpenPub` looks like:

````javascript
{
  'type': 'story',
  'format': 'http://format.example.com/openpub/version/1',
  'canonical': 'http://publisher.example.com/canonical-url',
  'version': 1,
  'cards': []
}
````

That's it.

A story has a `format` which links to the documentation for the corresponding version, a `canonical` URL which links to the content's "primary" location, a `version` number that is updated every time you revise the content, and a collection of `card`s--- *a.k.a.* the good stuff.

Each card is a collection of info related to the story, typically sharing a theme (like "geographic metadata" or "article source content").

**Anyone** in the `OpenPub` community is free to define cards and use them to capture interesting metadata. Cards that enter into wide usage will be documented here and deemed "blessed".

Blessed cards are more likely to be supported by **importers** and **exporters**, which we'll talk about [next][2].
